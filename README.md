### Investigating market inequality among top companies
- **Code:** [`Largest Companies by Revenue Analysis.ipynb`](https://github.com/pjurus/Portfolio/blob/main/Projects/Python/Largest%20Companies%20by%20Revenue%20Analysis.ipynb)
- **Skills:** Web scraping, data cleaning, data analysis, data visualization
- **Technology:** BeautifulSoup, pandas, seaborn, matplotlib, NumPy
- **Description:** The purpose of this analysis is to investigate market inequality among the 50 largest companies by revenue measured using the Gini coefficient (integrating with the trapezoidal method) and Lorenz curve. Since the coefficient is low, the analysis indicates a relatively low level of inequality. The data was scrapped from [`Wikipedia`](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_largest_companies_by_revenue).
