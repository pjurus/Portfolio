### Investigating Market Inequality Among Top Companies
- **Code:** [`Largest Companies by Revenue Analysis.ipynb`](https://github.com/pjurus/Portfolio/blob/main/Projects/Python/Largest%20Companies%20by%20Revenue%20Analysis.ipynb)
- **Skills:** Web scraping, data cleaning, data analysis, data visualization
- **Technology:** BeautifulSoup, requests, pandas, seaborn, matplotlib, NumPy
- **Description:** The purpose of this analysis is to investigate market inequality among the 50 largest companies by revenue measured using the Gini coefficient (integrating with the trapezoidal method) and the Lorenz curve. Since the coefficient is low, the analysis indicates a relatively low level of inequality. The data was scrapped from [`Wikipedia`](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_largest_companies_by_revenue).
### The Phillips Curve Analysis - Spearman's Rank Correlation Coefficient
- **Code:** [`The Phillips Curve - Spearman's Rank Correlation Analysis.ipynb`](https://github.com/pjurus/Portfolio/blob/main/Projects/Python/The%20Phillips%20Curve%20-%20Spearman's%20Rank%20Correlation%20Analysis.ipynb)
- **Skills:** data cleaning, data analysis, data visualization
- **Technology:** pandas, NumPy, SciPy, plotly
- **Description:** The Phillips curve states that inflation and unemployment have an inverse relationship - higher inflation is associated with lower unemployment and vice versa. The purpose of this analysis is to investigate this among the countries in the world in the period of **1999-2023**. We can observe that it tends to work in some countries.
